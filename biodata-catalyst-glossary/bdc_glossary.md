# BioData Catalyst Glossary

* **Agile Development**

  Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer\(s\)/end user\(s\).

* **Alpha Users**

  A small group of users who are more willing to tolerate working in a system that isn’t as fully developed, providing detailed feedback & maybe some back & forth discussions

* **\[Amazon\] EFS**

  \[Amazon\] Elastic File System a simple, scalable, elastic file system for Linux-based workloads for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

* **Ambassadors**

  A small group of experts that represent the personas featured within the priority User Narratives. For their time and help, Ambassadors will receive early access to the BioData Catalyst platform, free compute time, monetary fee for time, and relevant travel expenses will be covered.

* **API**

  Application Programmer Interfaces. API technologies serve as software-based intermediaries to exchange data.

* **AWS**

  Amazon Web Services. A provider of cloud services available on-demand.

* **BagIt**

  BagIt is a hierarchical file packaging format for storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content.

* **BDC3**

  BioData Catalyst Coordinating Center

* **Beta Users**

  A slightly larger group than the alpha users who are not as tolerant to a difficult/clunky environment but understand that the version they are using is not polished and they need to give feedback.

* **Beta-User Training**

  Once the platform is available to a broader audience, we will support freely-accessible online training for beta-users at any time.

* **Carpentries Instructor Training Program**

  Ambassadors attend this training program to become BioData Catalyst trainers.

* **CCM**

  Change Control Management; the systematic approach to managing all changes made to a document or process. Ensures no unnecessary changes are made, all changes are documented, and a process exists for implementing approved change.

* **CIO**

  Chief Information Officer

* **Cloud Computing**

  Internet-based computing, wherein computing power, networking, storage or applications running on computers outside an organization are presented to that organization in a secure, services-oriented way.

* **Components**

  Software units that implement a specific function or functions and which can be reused.

* **ConOps**

  Concept of Operations

* **Consortium**

  A collection of teams and stakeholders working to deliver on the common goals of integrated and advanced cyberinfrastructure, leading-edge data management and analysis tools, FAIR data, and HLBS researcher engagement.

* **Containers**

  A standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another \(for example, Docker\).

* **COPDGene**

  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease \(COPD\) Gene

* **Cost Monitoring \(level\)**

  At the Epic Level  
   The Coordinating Center will facilitate this process by developing reporting templates \(see example in PM Plan, Financial Management\) for distribution to the teams. The BioData Catalyst teams will complete these templates and send them directly to NHLBI.  
   Each team is responsible for tracking their finances based upon the award conditions and for providing status updates as requested to NHLBI.

* **CRAM File** Compressed columnar file format for storing biological sequences aligned to a reference sequence. Designed to be an efficient reference-based alternative to the Sequence Alignment Map \(SAM\) and Binary Alignment Map \(BAM\) file formats. It optionally uses a genomic reference to describe differences between the aligned sequence fragments and the reference sequence, reducing storage costs. Additionally each column in the SAM format is separated into its own blocks, improving compression ratio. CRAM files typically vary from 30 to 60% smaller than BAM, depending on the data held within them _\(from Wikipedia\)_.
