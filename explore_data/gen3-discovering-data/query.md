# Query

## Query Page

The Query page can search and return metadata from either the Flat Model or the Graph Model of a commons. Using GraphQL, these searches can be tailored to filter and return fields of interest for the data sets being queried. These queries can be made immediately after data submission as this queries the model directly.

For more information about how to use the Query page, please visit the Gen3 [documentation](https://gen3.org/resources/user/access-data/), under the `Querying Metadata Using the GraphiQL Interface` section.
