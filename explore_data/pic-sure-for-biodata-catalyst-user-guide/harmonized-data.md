# Harmonized Data

**TOPMed Harmonized Clinical Variables**

Additionally, there are limited amounts of harmonized data available at this time. The TOPMed Data Coordinating Center curation team has identified forty-four \(44\) variables that are shared across seventeen \(17\) NHLBI studies and has normalized the patient values for these variables. The 17 studies whence the 44 clinical variables have been identified, in alphabetic order, are:

* Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study \(ARIC\)
* Cardiovascular Health Study \(CHS\)
* Cleveland Family Study \(CFS\)
* Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study \(CARDIA\)
* Epidemiology of Asthma in Costa Rica Study \(CRA\)
* Framingham Heart Study \(FHS\)
* Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy \(GENOA\)
* Genetic Epidemiology of COPD \(COPDGene\)
* Genetics of Cardiometabolic Health in Amish \(Amish\)
* Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network Study \(GOLDN\)
* Genome-Wide Association Study of Venous Thrombosis Study \(VTE\)
* Heart and Vascular Health Study \(HVH\)
* Hispanic Community Health Study - Study of Latinos \(HCHS\_SOL\)
* Jackson Heart Study \(JHS\)
* Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis \(MESA\)
* Study of Adiposity in Samoans \(SAS\)
* Women’s Health Initiative \(WHI\)
