# Who We Are

**Our Culture:**  
  
Though the primary goal of the BioData Catalyst project is to build a data science ecosystem, at its core, this is a people-centric endeavor. BioData Catalyst is also building a _**community of practice**_ working collaboratively to solve technical and scientific challenges in biomedical science.

**Principal Investigators \(PIs\):**

* **Stan Ahalt**, PI RENCI \(Coordination Center\)
* **Rebecca Boyles**, Co-PI RTI \(Coordination Center\)
